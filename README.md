Task Completed
----------------

1-Frontend
Live: https://task-seven-alpha.vercel.app/
GitHub: https://github.com/Md-Sagar-Miah/task.git

2-Backend:
GitHub: https://github.com/Md-Sagar-Miah/multipleFileUpload-API.git

Note: For Backend connection you need to clone the backend repository in local device and I give here require database URL in .env file so it also pushed on GitHub.

To run the backend you need to run this command -> npm run dev

After run the backend sever the frontend can interact with the backend.
To upload file you must need to run the server in local machine. 

Thank you.
